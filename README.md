This is the one part of fake audio or fake image creation using Generative Adversarial Network or GAN
GAN, it contain two part first one Generator and Second one Discriminator 
Generator creates fake data like image, video, and audio 
On same time discriminator try to discriminate between real and fake, like the generated image or audio is fake or real
Important, given code is implemented in COLAB so you just need to click on the given colab link and check the working of GAN
For dataset, you don't worry it will automatically download from "tf.keras.datasets.mnist.load_data()" package.
